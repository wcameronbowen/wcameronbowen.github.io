My first post was on [how I setup this site](/jekyll/2024/01/13/setting-up-this-site.html). But thoughts and experiences behind why I created this site are much more interesting. God knows there are enough blogs to fill _insert large area/geographic structure here_. This blog is not a recipe to share or a new way of accomplishing your top 10 goals this year. This site is the result of several realizations, the most influential being that **writing is thinking**. I hated writing in school, I frequently struggled to meet the arbitrary word limit. I remember being forced to write non-stop for 10 minutes every day in a college English class. I loved it. How did I hate writing research papers, but loved writing for 10 minutes every day? There are numerous benefits to writing, less stress/anxiety, better sleep, etc. They seem to stem from that core idea that **writing is thinking**.

The more time I spend zoning out in front of a screen or even reading a book, but never doing anything with that information, the less thinking I am doing. I'm becoming a consumer and as an image of God I have a drive to create. The need to tilt the balance of my life from consumption to creation is a big part of the why behind this site.

I enjoy [wondering][working-genius], but the curse of that gift is spending a lot of time in my head. It truly is a gift, don't get me wrong, but it can take a turn into laziness and over thinking, even into very negative critical thinking at times. I've found the best ways to combat those tendencies are to:

Somewhere in between the threads of exploring the idea that **writing is thinking**, being more of a creator than consumer, and turning my wonderings into something concrete, lies the reason for this site.

Create -  this forces me to actually take the things I'm wondering or pondering over and do something with them, so much of my wondering is untested and that creates a vagueness that is frustrating.

Do: this may be part of [tenacity][working-genius], but I often feel a drive to get things done. I have a hard time sitting down and enjoying just spending time with people if there is not something being accomplished (I'm working on it, having children has really forced me to accept that not every interaction with a person is productive in a tangible way).

Be Grateful: this is the hardest of them all, and certainly the [core value](https://wcameronbowen/about) that I struggle most with.  

In keeping with the goal of this site you will enjoy a wonderfully ad-free experience. If you ever see an ad on this site, something has gone horribly wrong and you can assume there's been a malicious takeover of the site!

The goal of this site is to excercise those more. Especially the first two, I'll likely make a lot of notes about how to do things in the technical world, especially things I don't find on the first few pages of duck duck go or google. We'll see if I eventually **wonder** into more interesting topics!
