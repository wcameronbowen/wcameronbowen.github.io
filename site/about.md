# About

My name is Cameron Bowen. I am a follower of Jesus, father, husband, small business owner, and friend. I enjoy learning and strive to put knowledge to practical use. 

My goal with this site is to improve my thinking by forcing me to do more than just jot down thoughts since they will be public. This site will also help with some of my core values, namely **Transparency**.

Core Values:
- Learning
- Intentionality
- Faith
- Transparency
- Gratitude
