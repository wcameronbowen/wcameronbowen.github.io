This paragraph is not used as a post excerpt, even though it's the first paragraph
in the page. 

<post-excerpt>
This is the second post. It was written <post-date datetime="1970-01-02">shortly after the first one</post-date>.
Its title is not very imaginative: <post-title>My second post</post-title>. The only interesting thing about it
is that the metadata is embedded in the post body rather than written before any real content.
